There is a sample for File Management of the messaging group:
Here are simple details

* ***src/client*** : This is where we have all our views that appear to the user of the app(Front-end).
* ***src/server/models*** : Here we define our db like classes that have setters and getters of all db properies.
* ***src/server/repositories*** : Here we define a Repository for our Model, here we define methods to reach directly to the db simply, aha niho dushyira our db queries check the FileRepositoryClass.
* ***src/server/services*** : Here goes our logic, services join repositories to controllers, data from repository is manipulated here.  Check the FileService  Class. 
* ***src/server/dataDecoders*** : These are different methods that decodes request data sent over a tcp server.
* ***src/server/requestHandles*** : These are different methods that handles request basing on their type.
* ***src/server/routes*** : Here you find different models routes: ie. user different from messages and so and so forth.
* ***src/server/config*** : Our global project configurations.
* ***src/utils*** : Our Utilities, some common methods we may need and so on, ____You will also find the db migration file___.

* This error is encountered mainly when you pull codes that haven't been compiled by the uploader. 
* So the production folder contains code which are not compiled, when you line 
* You encounter some errors like missing some classes that are properly imported or others. Try it!
